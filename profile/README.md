## Explain the intersection or morphism between three groups

0) It's like solitaire; you can play the game alone ... or you can make it social and ask others to play.

1) Quasi-randomly select three groups to start. The three groups should not typically be grouped together but you can decide how random your selection actually is, so maybe your groups will be typically somewhat grouped together.

2) Good answers about the intersection or morphism must involve original, non-binary thinking. Or maybe not, ie you are certainly free to play the game wrong or right or however you want to play it.

3) The wrongest of all wrong answers will recieve bonus* points**.


------
*Bonus points are worth 10X more than regular points; they are like style points except more meaningful.

**Nobody is actually keeping score when it comes any kind of points. You are free to keep score, thus this game is much like your reputation or the way which you choose to categorize yourself, ie except for you, ***nobody else really cares*** about that stuff; relax, you've won -- the score doesn't matter.
