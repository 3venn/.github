## Explain the intersection or morphism between three groups

1) The three groups are not usually grouped together, so good answers must involve original, non-binary thinking. Or maybe not, ie you are free to play the game wrong or right or however you want to play it.

2) The wrongest of all wrong answers will recieve bonus* points**.


------
*Bonus points are worth 10X more than regular points; they are like style points except more meaningful.

**Nobody is actually keeping score when it comes any kind of points. You are free to keep score, thus this game is much like your reputation or the way which you choose to categorize yourself, ie except for you, ***nobody else really cares*** about that stuff; relax, you've won -- the score doesn't matter.
